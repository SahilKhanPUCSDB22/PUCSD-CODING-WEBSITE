1
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,045
Dr. Cotter.

2
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,297
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die.

3
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,007
I'm gonna die. Everybody dies.

4
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,176
I don't wanna... I'm gonna...

5
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,638
I haven't been able to get him to talk...

6
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,139
respond to me, nothing.

7
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,100
Just this.

8
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,186
Yeah. I got it.

9
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,188
Thanks, Dan.

10
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,399
She's gonna die. Mom's gonna die.
I'm gonna die. Everyone dies.

11
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,487
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter. Mom doesn't matter.

12
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,657
I don't matter.
Nothing ever matters. I don't matter.

13
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,576
I don't matter.
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.

14
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,120
He's gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Everyone dies.

15
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,082
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter.

16
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,334
Everyone dies. I'm gonna die.
Nobody matters.

17
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,461
She doesn't matter. He doesn't matter.

18
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,297
Mom doesn't matter.
Nothing ever matters. I don't matter.

19
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,634
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

20
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,720
She's gonna... She's gonna...
Everyone... I'm gonna...

21
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,889
I don't matter. I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

22
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,979
Hi, Carl.

23
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,650
What's going on today?

24
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,362
I'm dying.

25
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,446
No.

26
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,907
I don't think so.

27
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,079
I think you're having
another manic episode.

28
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
Don't...

29
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,207
Don't you tell me.

30
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,668
You don't know.

31
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,630
I feel it all around me, squeezing.

32
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,761
I'm scared.

33
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:45,600
Carl, I know
that what you're experiencing feels real,

34
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,644
but it can't hurt you.

35
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,692
I promise.

36
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,863
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die. I'm gonna die.

37
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,365
Everyone dies.
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.

38
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,616
Hey, Wanda.

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,203
I'm gonna put Carl Renken into observation
for a few days. He's harmless.

40
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,706
Just make sure someone checks on him
every couple hours.

41
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,332
- You got it.
- Thanks.

42
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,626
Hey, Dr. Desai was looking for you.

43
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,628
Thank you.

44
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,976
No! No! Please!

45
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,021
Please! You don't understand!
I can't go in there! No!

46
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,399
No! No! Please!

47
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,671
Come in.

48
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,134
Hey, did you send a patient named...

49
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,679
Sarah Marquet over to residency yesterday?

50
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,724
Yes. She has a history
with drug abuse and mania,

51
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,310
and she's been in and out of our unit
a few times.

52
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,978
Rose, she has no insurance.

53
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,563
Okay, but she needs treatment.

54
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,732
The board is down my throat
about paying out of pocket

55
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,526
for another bed in the residency program.

56
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:21,738
The board should try giving a shit about
the point of our job here once in a while.

57
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm not questioning your judgment.

58
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,328
I need you to come to me first
so I can get ahead of it next time.

59
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,621
- All right?
- Yes.

60
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,414
Okay. I'm sorry.

61
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,876
Hey, you haven't been here
since the late shift last night, have you?

62
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,538
Dr. Cotter.

63
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,999
Laura Weaver, 26. She's a grad student.

64
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,209
Police were called on her
for public disturbance.

65
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,211
- EMS brought her in.
- Got any psych history?

66
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,255
Nothing on file,
but the police sent over a report

67
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,632
for a different incident
she was involved in last week.

68
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,134
And what was that one about?

69
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,762
A professor at her school
bludgeoned himself to death with a hammer.

70
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,015
She was interviewed as the only witness.

71
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,433
A hammer?

72
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,652
Hi.

73
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,529
Laura?

74
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,244
My name is Dr. Cotter. I'm a therapist.

75
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,537
Do you wanna sit down?

76
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,917
Okay.

77
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,545
I know you're nervous.

78
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,172
That's okay.

79
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,133
I just wanna have a chat.

80
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,636
I promise this is a safe place.

81
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,180
Not for me.

82
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,141
Why do you say that?

83
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,066
Come on. Let's sit.

84
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:30,909
Please.

85
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,596
Okay. I'm gonna ask you some questions
that might sound stupid.

86
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,185
What day of the week is it?

87
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,145
Thursday.

88
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,398
And the month?

89
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,983
October. I'm not crazy.

90
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,694
- Nobody's saying that.
- No, but I need you to understand.

91
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,780
I'm a PhD candidate.
I'm not some lunatic. Okay?

92
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:13,702
Let's just take a breath,
and you can just tell me what's going on.

93
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,547
I'm seeing something.

94
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,010
Something no one else can see
except for me.

95
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,848
I know how insane that sounds. I do.

96
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,184
But it's... This thing, I can't explain it.

97
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,312
What is it you're seeing?

98
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,859
It looks like people,
but it's not a person.

99
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm not sure I understand.

100
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,573
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

101
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,284
Sometimes it pretends to be someone
that I know.

102
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,078
Sometimes it's a random stranger.
Sometimes...

103
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:02,083
Sometimes it looks like my grandfather
who died in front of me when I was seven.

104
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,838
But it's all the same thing. It...

105
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,259
It's... It's like...

106
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,057
It's like it wears people's faces
like masks.

107
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,644
Okay. Do you see it right now, here?

108
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,068
What happens when you do see it?

109
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,364
It's smiling at me.

110
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,284
But not a friendly smile.

111
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,411
It's the worst smile I've ever seen
in my life.

112
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,873
Whenever I see it,
I just get this god-awful feeling

113
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,126
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

114
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,047
I've never felt scared like I do
when I see it.

115
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,510
Laura, have you
or anyone else in your family

116
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,970
ever experienced hallucinations?

117
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,889
It's not a hallucination, no. It's real.

118
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,974
You don't get it. It does things to me.

119
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,143
It causes shit to happen around me.

120
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,647
It's taken over my whole life
and my mind and...

121
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,817
it tells me things.

122
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,446
It told me that today... Today's the...

123
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,991
Today's the day that I'm... I'm gonna...

124
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,618
Okay. That's okay.

125
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,828
That's okay.

126
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:26,376
I know that what you're experiencing
feels incredibly real.

127
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,712
Sometimes,
when we get emotionally overwhelmed,

128
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,424
or experience an intense trauma,
our minds want to...

129
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,884
You're not listening to me.

130
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,636
My God.

131
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,224
I'm gonna fucking die,
and no one will listen to me.

132
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,767
Okay. Laura, it's okay.

133
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,019
God.

134
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,939
Hey, it's okay. Laura.

135
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,858
Hey, can you look at me, please?

136
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,610
It's okay.

137
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,779
Look at me.

138
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,788
My God. No!

139
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,165
No! It's here!

140
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,583
- Get away!
- Laura. It's okay.

141
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,792
- It's just us.
- Please! No!

142
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,085
- There's nobody else here.
- No!

143
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,131
No!

144
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,097
My God.

145
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,353
I have a patient emergency in eval 2.
I need staff here now.

146
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:28,897
Hurry.

147
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:50,919
Laura?

148
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,682
Had Ms. Weaver
ever been a patient here before?

149
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,767
No.

150
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,811
Would you say she was typical
of the patients you see here?

151
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,731
This is an emergency psychiatric unit.

152
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,068
Typical is not really a thing here.

153
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,236
Right. But she was a head case, yeah?

154
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,238
I'm sorry, a head case?

155
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:32,455
I think we're just trying to get
your opinion of her mental state.

156
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:39,212
She could've been suffering from...
acute post-trauma psychosis.

157
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,425
She was having paranoid delusions.

158
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,219
What kind of delusions?

159
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:52,058
She was convinced that some...
sort of evil presence was haunting her.

160
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,352
Yikes.

161
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,148
It's just, we're gonna have to contact
Ms. Weaver's family

162
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,192
and attempt to explain what happened.

163
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,196
So we're looking for anything
that might make some sense of all this.

164
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,200
If there's anything else you can tell us,
that... that might help.

165
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,255
Before she died...

166
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,010
she was... smiling.

167
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,472
Yeah, she sounds fucking crazy to me.

168
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,050
Rose.

169
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,636
Whoa.

170
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,390
My bad. Did I scare you?

171
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,851
I didn't hear you come in. Shit.

172
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,728
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,812
Hi.

174
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,648
What's up?

175
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,900
Nothing. Sorry.

176
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,737
Something's wrong.

177
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,117
A patient died today.

178
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,744
My patient.

179
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,788
Hey, come here.

180
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,082
I'm sorry.

181
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,377
It happened right in front of me.

182
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,338
It was awful.

183
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,507
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

184
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,804
This is a nice start.

185
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,563
Maybe we should bail on dinner tonight.

186
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,652
We can't.

187
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,322
Holly hired a sitter,

188
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,325
and she's gonna be a bigger headache
if we don't go.

189
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,494
No way. Holly turning into a headache?

190
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,039
Hey.

191
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,678
I'm sorry, you want to talk to me
about being tired?

192
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:43,057
Now that Jackson's in the first grade,
I'm literally up at 6:00 a.m. every day

193
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,434
to make him breakfast and pack him lunch.

194
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,230
God knows what kind of nonorganic garbage
that cafeteria is even serving.

195
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,773
Then I have to drive him to school,

196
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,942
barely have any time
to run my own errands.

197
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,360
I haven't been to Pilates in weeks.

198
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,195
- Okay, my body is so fucked.
- Not true.

199
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,197
Then I have to go back to school,
pick him up,

200
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,282
then I have to take him
to either soccer practice,

201
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,034
swim lessons, karate, theater...

202
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,036
And he just started taking Spanish.

203
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,872
I mean, my weekdays
are literally impossible.

204
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,794
You are coming Saturday, right?

205
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,963
What?

206
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,507
Sorry, what's Saturday?

207
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,009
- I'm sorry, is that a joke?
- Wow.

208
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:23,222
Rose, Jackson's seventh birthday party.
I've told you, like, five times.

209
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,640
I can't. I have work.

210
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,602
- What do you mean work? It's Saturday.
- I work Saturday.

211
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,605
See, this is exactly why you have to
get out of that gross hospital

212
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,691
- and into a private practice...
- Gross?

213
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,901
- It is not gross.
- to work normal-people hours.

214
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,821
Rose, there have to be
plenty of crazies out there

215
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,656
who will actually pay you for your time.

216
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,285
Thank you so much for your input, Greg.
That's very sweet.

217
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,414
I'm just saying, why become a doctor
if you can't get disgustingly rich?

218
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,582
You're kidding, right?

219
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,710
Rose loves being a doctor.
She'd do it for free.

220
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,049
Well, on the subject
of wasted earning potentials,

221
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,552
- we could sell the fucking house.
- Can we not right now?

222
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,596
I don't understand.
It's just sitting there.

223
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,514
We grew up in that house.

224
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,476
Rose, it's a total teardown.
Why not just get the money for the land?

225
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,269
Can you guys just shut the fuck up?

226
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,730
Wow.

227
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,816
Thank you.

228
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,193
Thank you so much.

229
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,155
I've been looking forward to this.

230
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,314
You okay?

231
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,899
Yeah.

232
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,793
Morning, Doc.

233
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,297
Morning.

234
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,601
Hey. Yesterday,
that patient, Laura Weaver...

235
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,145
The police had sent a report
about a different incident

236
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,564
that she was involved in.

237
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,316
- Can you get that forwarded to me?
- You got it, Doc.

238
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,027
Also, I was supposed to have
a session with Jane Park.

239
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,530
Yeah. She pulled out
a bunch of her hair overnight

240
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,948
and swallowed it all.

241
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,534
They took her down to medicine
to have her stomach pumped.

242
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,618
Shit.

243
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,247
Rose.

244
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,712
- What... What are you...
- I was on a call nearby,

245
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,171
and I just thought I would...

246
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:08,679
We didn't really get to talk yesterday,
other than the whole... whole thing.

247
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,724
And I just wanted you to know that,
when the call came in,

248
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,226
I had no idea it was gonna be you.

249
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,936
So, I'm sorry if that was weird.

250
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,813
It's your job. I get it.

251
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,691
How you been?

252
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,067
Joel, why are you here?

253
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,488
Like I said,
I was on a call nearby, and I just...

254
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,698
I thought I would...

255
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,243
come check on you.

256
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,414
After everything that happened yesterday,
that's not an easy thing.

257
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,251
Okay. I appreciate it,
but I don't need you to check on me.

258
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,049
Right.

259
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,260
No, yeah, I mean... Sorry.

260
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,263
I have to get back to work.

261
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,807
- Yeah.
- See you around.

262
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,150
You do know she's engaged, right?

263
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,528
Yeah.

264
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
I'm single.

265
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,112
- Hello.
- Hi.

266
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,906
Look, I just wanted to say sorry
about last night.

267
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,450
I shouldn't have
kept going at you like that.

268
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,369
No, I...

269
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,746
I should apologize.

270
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,791
I've been just dealing with some stuff.

271
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,584
I wasn't being very good company.

272
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,088
Okay. if you can't make it
to your nephew's party tomorrow,

273
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,881
you could at least get him a present.

274
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,885
If you need an idea,
he's really into electric model trains.

275
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,848
You sound weird. Are you okay?

276
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,558
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

277
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,002
Hey, Carl.

278
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,172
How are you feeling today?

279
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,476
Carl.

280
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:06,982
Carl?

281
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,616
She's gonna die. I'm gonna die.

282
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,451
- Everybody dies.
- Carl, look at me.

283
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,369
You're going to die.

284
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,080
You're going to die.

285
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,831
You're going to die.

286
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,376
You're going to die. You're going to die.

287
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,630
You're going to die. You're going to die.

288
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,381
- You're going to die.
- Help!

289
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,675
Help! This patient is 5150!

290
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,594
- He needs to be restrained!
- Go, go, go!

291
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,847
No! No!

292
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,140
No!

293
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,686
No! No! No! No!

294
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,814
No! No!

295
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,483
No! No!

296
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,819
No!

297
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,997
He was aggressive.

298
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,000
Acting psychotic.

299
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,711
Carl Renken has been
in and out of here a dozen times

300
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,006
and has never exhibited behavior
even remotely aggressive.

301
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,259
- Do you think I'm making it up?
- Of course not.

302
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:20,180
But yesterday, a patient in your care
killed herself brutally in front of you.

303
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:25,060
Is it possible, when you presumed
that Carl Renken was a danger to himself,

304
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,396
that that's what your mind
was reacting to?

305
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:34,653
I suppose I could've misinterpreted
the situation and overreacted.

306
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,532
Okay.

307
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,118
So, here's what's gonna happen.

308
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,580
You're gonna take a paid week off.

309
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,415
Morgan, that's really not necessary.

310
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,877
You've been working 80-hour weeks
for months.

311
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,337
I'm concerned
that you haven't been sleeping.

312
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,592
We can't help these patients unless
we have our own mental health in check.

313
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,468
And it's in the unit's best interest

314
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,679
if you just take a week
and clear your head.

315
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,891
Just do what you gotta do
and come back focused, okay?

316
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,251
Fuck!

317
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,700
- Hello?
- This is First Line Security.

318
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,035
May I have your name and the passcode?

319
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,079
Rose Cotter.

320
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,539
"Acapulco."

321
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,458
Ma'am, we've detected a door alarm.

322
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,336
Yeah, the... the back door
of my house is open.

323
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,172
Are you alone in the house, ma'am?

324
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,798
Yes.

325
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,258
Are you sure?

326
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,011
What?

327
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,097
Are you sure
you haven't let something inside, Rose?

328
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,310
Look behind you.

329
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,008
Shit.

330
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,142
Hello?

331
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,769
This is First Line Security.

332
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,896
May I have your name and the passcode?

333
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,836
We did a full sweep inside and out.
It's all clear.

334
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,422
What about the back door?

335
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:12,551
Is it possible it wasn't fully latched
last time it was closed?

336
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,762
I don't know. Maybe.

337
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,683
I wouldn't worry about it.
These false alarms happen all the time.

338
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,894
If anything else comes up,
you can give us a call.

339
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,896
Okay.

340
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,274
Evening, sir.

341
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,901
Evening.

342
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,781
What happened?

343
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,661
Mustache?

344
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,664
Mustache.

345
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,418
So, is there a reason you set the alarm?

346
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,463
I literally don't remember doing it.

347
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,425
I must have just, like,
set it by accident or something.

348
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,511
By accident?

349
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,639
Sorry. Sorry.

350
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:04,728
My head has just been in this, like,
foggy, creepy, spacey place all day.

351
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,814
And there was this weird incident at work,
and then...

352
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,983
And then my boss is making me take a...

353
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,489
Sorry.

354
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,534
- Everything's okay.
- Are you sure?

355
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,454
No, I'm fine. I was just venting.

356
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,749
Okay.

357
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,547
Can you see if you can find Mustache?

358
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,507
I haven't seen him anywhere at all.

359
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,717
Yeah.

360
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,559
Rose, did you break another glass?

361
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,607
Mustache?

362
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,487
Come on, kitty.

363
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,200
Please. Please.

364
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,288
Mustache.

365
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,680
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

366
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,266
Sometimes it pretends to be someone
that I know.

367
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,144
Sometimes it's a random stranger.
Sometimes..

368
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:14,023
Sometimes it looks like my grandfather
who died in front of me when I was seven.

369
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,609
But it's all the same thing. It..

370
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,988
It's smiling at me,
but not a friendly smile.

371
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,449
It's the worst smile I've ever seen
in my life.

372
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,034
Whenever I see it,
I just get this god. awful feeling

373
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,121
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

374
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,417
My God! No! No!

375
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,627
No! It's here! Please!

376
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,131
Get away! Please! No!

377
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:44,721
I have a patient emergency in eval 2.
I need staff here now. Hurry.

378
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,766
Laura?

379
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,861
Laura?

380
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,332
Laura?

381
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,126
Rose.

382
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,427
Laura?

383
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,979
Rose!

384
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,408
Rose?

385
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,328
Whoa! My God! Rose! Rose! Whoa, whoa!

386
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,789
What the fuck? Rose, put the knife down!

387
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:57,961
Rose!

388
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,522
Hi.

389
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,608
Rose?

390
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,570
This is a surprise.

391
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,200
It wasn't so much the blood.

392
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,493
It was...

393
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,538
her face.

394
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,206
The look that she had.

395
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,917
How did it make you feel?

396
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,964
Terrified, obviously.

397
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,845
Vulnerable.

398
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,722
Guilty.

399
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,223
Guilty?

400
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,851
Well, she was my patient.

401
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,521
She was a disturbed young woman
you only met for ten minutes.

402
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,815
Yeah. I just...

403
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,319
I feel like I've gotten stuck on it.

404
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,654
I can't, you know, get it out of my head.

405
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,617
Have you considered
the reason you feel stuck

406
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,328
could actually be more about
your mother's suicide?

407
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,876
Do you still blame yourself?

408
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,171
That...

409
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:28,259
I'm really not trying to relitigate
that part of my life right now. So...

410
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,888
What would you like to talk about?

411
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:38,978
I was hoping that I could get
a script for Risperdal.

412
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,611
Ever since that...

413
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,323
patient, I've been...

414
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,077
seeing things...

415
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,829
and hearing things.

416
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,167
I'm sure it's just a symptom
of post-trauma.

417
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,503
Let's avoid any self-diagnosis.

418
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,548
What is it you've been seeing and hearing?

419
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,513
Echoes of what happened with my patient.

420
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,977
You know, just fleeting moments
of stress-induced hallucinations.

421
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,357
But when they're happening, they feel so...

422
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,278
corporeal and unsettling.

423
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:35,076
Rose, from where I'm sitting, you don't
seem delusional or disordered to me.

424
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,954
And certainly not psychotic.

425
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,915
It's my impression
this experience with your patient

426
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,752
triggered old anxieties compounded
with too much stress, not enough sleep.

427
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,381
You have wounds
that have never fully healed.

428
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:53,886
It's possible they never will completely.
That's the nature of trauma.

429
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,806
But you can learn to get control over it.

430
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,811
Have you been continuing to see patients

431
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,646
while you've been coping with all this?

432
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,525
- No. I'm just taking a short hiatus.
- Good.

433
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,405
If you want my advice,
use this time to do something different.

434
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:17,076
Anything that will take your mind off
the triggers that are causing you stress.

435
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,496
I also think it would be helpful...

436
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,208
if we resumed our regular sessions again.

437
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,506
Sure.

438
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,347
And what about the Risperdal?
Just... You know.

439
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:42,018
Let's talk again next week
before we consider any medication.

440
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,355
In the meantime, you can always call me.

441
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,486
Sure.

442
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,854
No, I asked you
for a white wine spritzer. Jesus.

443
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,942
- My God. You made it.
- Hi. Surprise.

444
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,443
Come on in. Come on in.

445
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,363
I thought you had to work?

446
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,949
- I decided to take the afternoon...
- I'll take that.

447
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,452
Hey. Greg. What are you doing?
I told you not to take those out yet.

448
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,454
Geez.

449
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,706
Ladies, I have to go corral
my dipshit husband.

450
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,501
Would one of you please show my sister
to the adult refreshments?

451
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,003
Sure. We have a stash
in the kitchen. Come on.

452
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,172
Wait. You're that therapist, right?

453
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,298
Yes, I am.

454
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,300
Fantastic. Can I ask for advice?

455
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:02,265
Happy birthday to you

456
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:07,520
Happy birthday to you

457
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:11,607
Happy birthday...

458
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,386
So cool.

459
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,598
Gracias, Harper. Gracias, Harper's mom.

460
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,479
That one's from Aunt Rose.

461
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,525
Open it!

462
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,861
Rip it open!

463
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,753
What'd you get, sweetheart?

464
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,019
No. No...

465
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,481
- My God.
- No, no. Mustache.

466
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,404
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- This can't be happening.

467
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,913
No. No, no.
No, I promise you, this wasn't me.

468
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,333
It wasn't. It wasn't me, I swear.

469
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,461
You have to...
You guys have to believe me, please.

470
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,422
Somebody please fucking believe me.

471
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,519
What the fuck are you?
Leave me the fuck alone!

472
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,730
You see her. You have to see her.

473
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,733
Please, Holly,
tell me that you see somebody.

474
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:18,859
Please.

475
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,728
- Hey, Rose.
- Fuck.

476
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,064
I heard you were brought into the ER.

477
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,066
I wanted to come check on you.
How're you doing?

478
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,068
Fine.

479
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,779
It was just an accident. Thank you.

480
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,491
Yeah. They said that you had
had an anxiety attack.

481
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,079
Rose, I'll be honest with you,
I'm concerned.

482
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,581
And I mean this as your friend,

483
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,875
but I really think
you should speak to someone.

484
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,210
Are you seeing anybody professionally
right now?

485
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,926
Rose, are you listening?

486
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,327
Wait.

487
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,830
I need to tell you something,

488
00:47:54,914 --> 00:48:00,503
and I need you to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

489
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,506
- Okay.
- Okay.

490
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,971
Something is happening to me.

491
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,770
And it's gonna be really hard
for you to believe.

492
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,900
Maybe we should just go inside.

493
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,402
No, wait. Just listen to me!

494
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,861
Sorry. Sorry.

495
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,322
I'm really sorry.

496
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,241
Okay...

497
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,953
Something is threatening me.

498
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:39,875
Some kind of evil spirit, or energy.

499
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:44,672
I don't really know what it is, but...

500
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:48,050
But I think that it killed my patient.

501
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:53,139
Because she described experiencing
the same thing before she died.

502
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:56,976
And now it's somehow
attached itself to me.

503
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,603
And...

504
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,859
I'm just really scared
that something bad is going to happen.

505
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,992
I really need you to say something.

506
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,911
What do you want me to say?

507
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,084
I want you to believe me.

508
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:24,295
Rose, you're talking about
a fucking ghost.

509
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,338
No, no, no. It's not...

510
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,715
It's not a ghost.

511
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,426
It's something else.

512
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,719
Okay.

513
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,724
I'm sorry.

514
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,101
I can't.

515
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,854
I cannot fucking do this right now.

516
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,439
No. Trevor.

517
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,649
Whoa, wait. No, no, no. Don't walk away.

518
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,737
I need you...
You're not listening to what I am saying.

519
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:55,409
Okay, Rose. What the fuck am I supposed
to say to respond to this right now?

520
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,537
Do you hear yourself?
Jesus Christ. You sound crazy.

521
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,331
I am not crazy!

522
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,249
Sorry. Sorry.

523
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,835
But it's genetic, isn't it?

524
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,296
What?

525
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:09,965
Mental illness.

526
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,136
You can inherit it from a parent.
I looked it up.

527
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,638
Why would you look that up?

528
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,848
Because...

529
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:22,478
I wanted to know what I was
potentially hitching my entire life to.

530
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,689
Is that so fucking unfair?

531
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,110
I'm going in the house.

532
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,488
No, no, no. Please, Trevor. I'm in danger!

533
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,572
Rose.

534
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,575
- Did you kill Mustache?
- No!

535
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,620
No! That was not... That was not me.

536
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,207
Then tell me, what happened to him?

537
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,461
It was the... thing.

538
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,673
Trevor, please.

539
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,466
Please. Please.

540
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,803
Please. Please.

541
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,004
Rose.

542
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,556
Come here.

543
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,337
Rose.

544
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,591
Baby...

545
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,470
Please. Help me.

546
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,933
- Mommy made a mistake.
- No, no, no.

547
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,978
No, no, no.

548
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,191
Rose!

549
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:18,028
- Look where you're going! Are you crazy?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

550
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,094
Mrs. Muñoz?

551
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,726
At first, I noticed small changes in him.

552
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:54,064
Then it all happened so fast.

553
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,609
He was on edge.

554
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,862
Paranoid.

555
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:04,700
He would wake up
in the middle of the night, screaming.

556
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,163
I'd never heard him scream before.

557
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,626
Then he just stopped sleeping altogether.

558
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:21,300
I would catch him
having these conversations with himself.

559
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,885
He was seeing things.

560
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:27,347
Doing strange things
that he didn't even seem to remember.

561
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,933
Then one morning he was gone.

562
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,481
That night, the police called
and told me he was dead.

563
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,195
They asked me to identify his body.

564
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:44,448
His face.

565
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,911
Twenty. five years of marriage,

566
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,789
and that's what I have left
to remember him.

567
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,503
I'm so sorry.

568
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:13,602
Did Gabriel ever
describe the things that he was seeing?

569
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,525
I'll show you.

570
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,288
I should take it all down,

571
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,208
but I can't stand being in here.

572
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,688
This is what Gabriel said he saw.

573
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:09,992
He kept saying
it was trying to get inside of him.

574
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,414
That is Gabriel's brother.

575
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,915
He died in an accident.

576
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,042
Twenty years ago.

577
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,712
Gabriel never got over it.

578
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,006
How long had this been going on?

579
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,090
Ever since he got back

580
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,551
from that damn conference
he would go to every year.

581
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,639
It was because he saw
that awful woman kill herself.

582
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,101
But no one reports on that.

583
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,523
He watched someone die by suicide?

584
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,276
Yes.

585
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,404
- I assumed you knew this.
- What was her name?

586
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,158
I don't remember. I'd have to find it.

587
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,874
Did... Did he ever...

588
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,086
say why all of this was happening?

589
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,381
Did he find any explanation
in all of this?

590
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,093
What kind of reporter are you?

591
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,931
Mrs. Muñoz, your husband was not insane.

592
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,558
The things that he was seeing,

593
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,185
they're real. I've seen them.

594
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,271
- What are you, a fucking nutcase?
- What?

595
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,566
Some kind of morbid fanatic?
How fucking dare you?

596
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,026
No, please. Please.

597
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,820
What happened to your husband
is happening to me.

598
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,031
Out of my house.
I want you out of my house, now.

599
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,408
Just please give me the name.
Just give me the name!

600
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,911
Get the fuck out of my house!

601
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,615
Fuck. Shit.

602
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,629
Yeah?

603
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,303
Hey.

604
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,395
Come on in.

605
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,662
Finally got rid of that ugly yellow couch.

606
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,876
So, what's up?

607
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,087
I assume you're not here to catch up

608
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,923
considering the cold shoulder
the other day.

609
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,635
I need a favor.

610
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,638
I need you to
not ask any questions about it.

611
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,516
Terrific. Yeah, let's hear that.

612
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,435
So, nine days ago,

613
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:27,022
a man named Gabriel Muñoz killed himself.

614
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:32,819
I need to know if he had been involved in
any other recent police reports.

615
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,447
Can you find that out? Here. For me.

616
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,824
Come on. Are you serious?

617
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,495
This is my one day off. Go to the station.

618
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,913
Joel, please?

619
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,797
Fine.

620
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,173
Goddamn it.

621
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,554
All right, what was his name again?

622
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,807
Gabriel Muñoz.

623
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,275
All right. I see the report on his death.

624
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:16,488
Yeah. There's another incident report here
from a week earlier,

625
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,781
from a precinct upstate.

626
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,949
What was it for?

627
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,909
He gave a witness statement.

628
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,620
He was staying at a hotel
where a woman committed suicide.

629
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,248
Okay. And what was her name? The woman?

630
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,588
Angela Powell.

631
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,590
She's a real estate agent.

632
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:36,758
What is this?

633
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,846
- Fuck.
- What? What is it?

634
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,557
It's a picture from the scene.

635
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,600
- Let me see it.
- No.

636
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:46,893
- Let me see it.
- No, no.

637
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,271
You don't wanna see this.
This is, like, evidence.

638
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,523
Or, just, you know, have at it.

639
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:55,986
Holy shit.

640
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,489
Told you it was gross.

641
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,617
Okay.

642
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,495
Okay.

643
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,081
I need you to do the same search again,
but this time on her.

644
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,291
The woman, Angela.

645
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,209
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

646
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:14,296
Joel, you said you weren't gonna
ask me any questions.

647
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,464
No. You said I wouldn't ask you
any questions...

648
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,341
Joel, I need your help.

649
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,677
Okay?

650
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,098
Please?

651
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:48,288
There was a previous report
filed four days before her death.

652
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:53,585
That's a weird coincidence.
She was also interviewed about a suicide.

653
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,639
What is this? Is that a video file?

654
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,728
It's security camera footage.

655
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,814
- Put it... Put it on.
- Just... It's loading.

656
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,576
What the fuck is this?

657
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,069
You know, my day was going just fine.

658
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,196
- Can you rewind it?
- Really?

659
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,823
Rewind it, Joel.

660
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,788
Okay, stop.

661
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,546
Is he smiling?

662
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,473
Rose, who are these people?

663
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,442
I have to go.

664
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,694
Where are you going?

665
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,449
Rose, where are you going?
What is going on here?

666
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,327
- I'm so confused right now.
- Can you do me one more favor?

667
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,746
Do you have a printer?

668
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,079
Trevor. Trevor, you here?

669
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,539
Hey.

670
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,832
Hi, Rose.

671
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,670
What is this? What is she doing here?

672
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,547
I wanted to see how you were doing.

673
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,466
I was talking to my fiancé.

674
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,177
I called her.

675
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,389
Why?

676
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:58,603
Because you've been acting
completely unhinged.

677
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,648
- I don't...
- And I... I didn't know what else to do.

678
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,233
Are you fucking kidding me?

679
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,321
I came to you. The person
I'm supposed to trust most in the world,

680
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:12,409
and I confided that I was scared to death.

681
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,703
That I needed you.

682
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,624
And you didn't listen
to a word I was saying.

683
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,626
No. Why do you think I even called her?

684
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,504
- All I'm trying to do here is help you.
- No!

685
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,507
All you're trying to do is make it
so you don't have to deal with it.

686
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:31,219
You're fine as long as everything
is easy and agreeable,

687
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:35,849
but God forbid anything become real,
or even a tiny bit difficult.

688
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,434
And... And you just...

689
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,479
You think about how it's gonna fuck up
your whole little perfect life plan.

690
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,482
- Whoa. Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

691
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:47,485
If that's how you feel,
then why are we even together?

692
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,905
- Maybe I just don't know.
- Why don't we all take a breath...

693
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,575
Why don't you just
fucking make yourself at home!

694
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,412
Rose, are you actually leaving right now?

695
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,633
- Greg.
- Rose, what are you doing here?

696
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,761
- Is Holly here? I need to talk to her.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

697
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,889
Let me talk to my fucking sister,
okay? Holly!

698
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,474
You're gonna come
and talk to me like that?

699
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,267
Holly, can I talk to you,
just for one sec?

700
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,977
- No, I don't think...
- Can I please talk to you?

701
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,812
I don't think this is a good idea.
Honestly.

702
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,647
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Holly.

703
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,609
- Just go the fuck inside.
- I don't think... All right. Fine.

704
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,944
Jesus.

705
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,572
Okay, okay, okay.

706
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,409
How are you?

707
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,830
My eyes are open now.

708
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,876
I have been cursed.

709
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,088
Or somehow wrapped up in a curse.

710
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,548
I got it from my patient.

711
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:54,385
She was cursed, and then when she died,
she transferred it to me.

712
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:59,849
And now I'm being threatened by this...
this entity.

713
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,686
- By an entity?
- No, no. It's what killed Mustache.

714
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,731
It was at the party yesterday,
but you couldn't see it.

715
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,859
Nobody else can see it, except for me.

716
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:11,486
Jesus Christ.

717
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,864
No. Look, Holly.
I know it's so hard to believe,

718
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,534
and it was difficult for me
to believe it at first either.

719
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,369
But look... look at this. Look.

720
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,580
My God. Rose.
Why the fuck do you have that?

721
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,666
Because this has happened to other people.

722
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,167
- And they're all dead.
- Rose.

723
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,669
And... Holly, I'm gonna be next!

724
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,170
Rose, curses are not real.

725
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,090
Okay? You are having some sort of a...

726
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,093
a breakdown.

727
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,221
What? No, no. Holly.

728
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,390
You're not hearing me.

729
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,475
- You are not hearing me.
- Rose.

730
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:45,562
This is exactly what happened to Mom.

731
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,944
You sound just like her.

732
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,201
How the fuck would you know that?

733
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:03,955
- I'm sorry, what?
- You were never around when Mom got bad.

734
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,707
Where the fuck were you when she died?

735
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,917
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

736
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:11,337
Okay? Because I was older,
I got the worst of Mom's insanity.

737
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,800
I had to fucking leave the house.
That was the only way I could survive.

738
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,429
And I'm... I'm sorry...

739
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:24,726
that I left you alone and that
you had to be the one to find her.

740
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,936
I know that that fucked you up, and...

741
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:31,065
And I know that that's not fair.
And I wish I could do something about it.

742
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:33,693
But, Rose, I have tried so hard
to move on with my life,

743
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,820
to leave all of that shit behind me, okay?

744
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,114
But you, it's like
you can't accept the fact

745
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,450
that Mom lost her mind
and fucking killed herself.

746
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,911
And you let it define your entire life,
and you punish me because I don't want to.

747
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,706
I'm sorry that I'm actually trying
to help people

748
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:50,418
instead of being some fucking
stay-at-home PTA housewife,

749
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:54,672
who lives in her own
self-centered, smug little bubble!

750
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,346
- Okay.
- I don't know why I said that.

751
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,018
You know what, I'm not doing this.
I'm not doing this with you.

752
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,312
You've completely traumatized Jackson,
okay?

753
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,274
I can't have you around
when you're like this.

754
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,995
Fuck.

755
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,581
Fuck.

756
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,696
Holly?

757
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,251
Fuck! Fuck!

758
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,715
Fuck!

759
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,092
Motherfucker!

760
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,660
Joel?

761
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:33,039
Why didn't you tell me about
your patient's connection to the others?

762
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:36,042
- Wha...
- After you left, I kept digging.

763
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,045
These cases? This same pattern.
It goes back further.

764
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,964
So far, I've found 20 cases
involving 19 suicide victims

765
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,050
with a direct line
linking them all together.

766
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:48,262
And the things these people are doing
to themselves, Rose. Holy shit.

767
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:52,099
Wait, you said 20 cases,
but only 19 suicides.

768
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:55,603
One of the cases mixes up the pattern.
Some accountant, Robert Talley.

769
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,189
His business partner commits suicide
right in front of him,

770
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,732
and four days later, Talley goes

771
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,734
and fucking murders a woman
he's never met,

772
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,110
completely out of the blue.

773
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,404
But get this, a week later,

774
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:09,325
the key eyewitness to the murder
also commits suicide.

775
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,701
Pattern resumes.

776
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,745
- So, he's alive?
- Yeah.

777
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,288
He's sitting in holding in Altoona.

778
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,749
Joel, I gotta talk to him.

779
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:47,280
- I'm gonna need you to say something.
- Yeah, I... I will.

780
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,990
Just... Just...

781
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,702
Give me a second. I mean, Jesus...

782
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,162
I thought you were gonna say
this was some kind of, like,

783
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,790
crazy suicide cult, or blackmail scheme.

784
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,501
- I mean, this? This is... This?
- But, Joel.

785
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:03,796
Okay.

786
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,340
Let's just put aside the possibility

787
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:09,510
that some sort of evil,
extraordinary force could even exist.

788
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,140
What you're saying
is that this thing is jumping around

789
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,977
from person to person,
and it is causing them to kill themselves?

790
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,313
Okay, but maybe it's not suicide.

791
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,606
What do you mean?

792
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:25,860
Okay. So, my patient, she was terrified,
but she was not suicidal.

793
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,113
And then at the end,
everything about her changed.

794
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:34,619
It was like the person
I had been talking to was gone.

795
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,957
And something else had taken over.

796
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,713
So, it's... it's kind of like the guy.

797
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,634
- On the security camera footage?
- Yes. Yes. Exactly like that.

798
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,428
My God. What the fuck?

799
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,728
In the cases that you found...

800
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:06,317
how long was it
between each victim's death?

801
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,907
None of them survived longer than a week.

802
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:19,664
Some of them didn't even make it
past four days.

803
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,672
Today was my fourth day.

804
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:30,800
Hey.

805
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:35,388
Whatever happened to those people,
it's not gonna happen to you.

806
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:39,350
I promise.

807
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,416
Transfer guard to gate three.

808
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,253
- Thank you.
- Give them a buzz through. They're clear.

809
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,966
I owe you one for this, Doug.

810
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:15,511
You're just lucky that he fired
every lawyer he was assigned.

811
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,930
You do know what this guy did, right?

812
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,182
Well, Dr. Cotter's building
a psychological profile

813
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,892
on a similar case for us.

814
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,854
Well, Talley's a whole box of fruit loops.

815
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,480
So, good luck.

816
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,524
Look, you only got
ten minutes with him, okay?

817
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,735
It's the best I could do
without a court order.

818
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,278
Well, I appreciate it.

819
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,524
Mr. Talley, my name is Dr. Rose Cotter,

820
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:16,322
and I was hoping you'd be willing
to answer some questions about...

821
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,824
I'm done answering questions. I confessed.

822
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:22,328
I actually don't care about
what you were accused of.

823
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:25,372
What I need to know
is what you experienced

824
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:27,625
in the days leading up to it.

825
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,590
I have a patient...

826
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:36,842
a young woman.

827
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,973
Four days ago, a man killed himself
right in front of her.

828
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:49,021
And ever since then,
she has been seeing something.

829
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,984
Something that pretends
to be other people.

830
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,196
The man that she saw kill himself,

831
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:02,118
he claimed that he was seeing
the exact same thing.

832
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,453
What the fuck do you want from me?

833
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,622
- What is it?
- I don't know.

834
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,083
I don't know.

835
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:13,379
Why is it that everybody else
who's seen it is dead and you're alive?

836
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,797
Why? Please.

837
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,049
Mr. Talley, you can help her. Okay?

838
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:18,759
Please.

839
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,557
Make the cop leave.

840
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,269
Not gonna happen, pal.

841
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:31,856
Make him leave,
and I'll tell you what I know.

842
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,443
Joel, please.

843
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,951
I'll be outside, all right?

844
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,426
I tried to research anything
and everything I could about this thing.

845
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,803
There's been other chains in the past.

846
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,389
Found one that was in Brazil
a few years ago.

847
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,145
A man there escaped that chain...

848
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,858
by killing his neighbor
and passing it to his neighbor's wife.

849
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,112
Your patient is going to die

850
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,573
unless she kills someone.

851
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,034
That's the only way you can get rid of it.

852
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,286
The only way.

853
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,039
She has to make sure there's a witness
for it to pass to,

854
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,166
'cause this thing needs trauma to spread.

855
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:35,878
That's what gives it power. Trauma.

856
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,672
Your patient has to make it count.

857
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:41,258
Tell her to use some kind of weapon.

858
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:43,427
Make the biggest mess she can...

859
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,887
I can't kill someone!

860
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:48,766
You?

861
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:51,685
You have it?

862
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,899
No, no, no.
Why the fuck did you come here?

863
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,692
You're not giving it back to me.

864
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:02,071
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- I'm sorry.

865
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,989
Get her away from me!

866
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,492
Get her away from me!

867
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,661
Get her away from me!

868
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,454
Get her away from me!

869
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:18,879
Hey.

870
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,548
Hey! Wait.

871
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:25,469
- What happened in there?
- Nothing.

872
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:27,596
What'd he say?

873
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,474
Nothing.

874
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,518
Nothing?

875
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,145
He's out of his fucking mind, Joel.

876
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,001
Fuck.

877
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:17,933
What are you doing here?

878
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,852
I apologize
if you felt ambushed yesterday.

879
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,729
- That was the wrong approach. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

880
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:25,190
- I think you should go.
- Rose,

881
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:28,110
we both know I have a responsibility
to notify the authorities

882
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,571
if you're a danger to yourself or others.

883
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,365
I need you to help convince me
you're not a danger.

884
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,755
Trevor mentioned there had been
talk of ghosts.

885
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,092
I never used the word "ghosts."

886
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,138
Evil beings, then. Paranormal.

887
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:01,602
I admitted to him
that I was seeing things,

888
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:03,270
the same thing that I told you.

889
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:07,774
That's not happening anymore. Okay?
It was stress and lack of sleep.

890
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,361
I confided in him,
and that was obviously a mistake.

891
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,572
But that's it.

892
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,532
Okay? Are we good?

893
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,619
How are you feeling today?

894
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:23,916
Let me think...

895
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:27,336
I'm pretty sure my fiancé
thinks I'm crazy.

896
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:34,218
My sister has just... totally shut me out.

897
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,719
And now...

898
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:41,600
my former therapist
is making unannounced house calls

899
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,102
to ensure that I am not a danger.

900
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:47,731
So, other than that, I'm really good.

901
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:59,451
Should you get that?

902
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,791
What?

903
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,001
Rose, it's Madeline.

904
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:11,004
I've been trying your mobile all morning.

905
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,424
I'm very concerned about
how we left things yesterday.

906
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,972
- Rose? Are you there?
- No.

907
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:26,520
Hello?

908
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,064
- No.
- Rose?

909
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:31,316
No. No.

910
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,069
Almost time, Rose.

911
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,322
What the fuck are you?

912
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,160
Please.

913
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:46,957
No, no.

914
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,668
No. No, no.

915
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,050
No.

916
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,413
Hey, Dr. Cotter.

917
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,999
Aren't you supposed to be on leave?

918
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,044
Just grabbing something from my office.

919
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,627
Carl. Hi.

920
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,299
- No. No.
- It's okay.

921
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:02,968
No, no, no.

922
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,803
- It's okay.
- God.

923
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,972
No, no, no.

924
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,600
- Just calm down.
- No! No, no!

925
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,394
Shut the fuck up.

926
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,480
Just calm down, okay? Okay.

927
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,732
Rose.

928
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:18,942
What are you doing here?

929
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:23,822
I don't know.

930
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,868
Rose, you can't be around patients.

931
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,194
Fuck! Rose!

932
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,258
Fuck!

933
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,942
Rose, what are you doing here?

934
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:43,985
Nothing.

935
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:46,822
I don't... I don't know.

936
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,407
I don't know why. I...

937
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,202
Why don't we go inside
and we can just talk?

938
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,787
No! It's...

939
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,038
It's not safe.

940
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,582
Rose, I don't think you should
be alone right now.

941
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,084
I need to be alone.

942
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,338
I need to be... I need to be alone.

943
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:08,176
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go.

944
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:12,848
Rose, I don't think you should
go anywhere, okay?

945
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,308
You just relax, I'm gonna make
a phone call, all right?

946
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,603
Rose. Rose, don't go anywhere.

947
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,063
Wait. Rose, please.

948
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:22,107
Please don't go anywhere, okay?
Just hang...

949
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,401
Rose. Rose, wait! Rose!

950
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:51,595
Joel.

951
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:54,264
I just saw a police APB go out for you
that says you're dangerous.

952
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:55,432
What the fuck happened?

953
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:56,850
- I know what I need to do.
- What?

954
01:29:56,933 --> 01:30:01,605
This thing, it needs all of its victims
to pass it on in order to survive,

955
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:04,774
but if there's no one else around,
then it has no way to pass.

956
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:07,944
As long as I'm alone,
I can deprive it of what it needs.

957
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:11,865
That doesn't make any sense.
Your plan is to just avoid people forever?

958
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,618
I am not gonna keep running, okay?

959
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:16,661
I've got to face it.

960
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,331
Okay, Rose, I'm coming to you.
Just tell me where..

961
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,792
Rose.

962
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,506
Baby...

963
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:03,847
Help me, please.

964
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,145
Mommy made a mistake.

965
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:18,611
Get the phone.

966
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,573
Call for help.

967
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,334
Rose!

968
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:46,879
Rose.

969
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:54,887
It's okay, baby.

970
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,889
Come here.

971
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:11,821
I am so sorry.

972
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,367
I... I haven't been a good mom.

973
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:24,208
I want to be. I really try to be,

974
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:30,631
but sometimes everything is just too much.

975
01:39:32,258 --> 01:39:35,678
There is something terrible inside of me.

976
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:40,266
- I hate myself.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

977
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,393
Are you ashamed of me?

978
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:44,937
No.

979
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,148
Then why did you let me die?

980
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:53,571
- Why didn't you save me?
- It's not my fault.

981
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,407
- You could have called for help.
- Stop. Stop it.

982
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:58,409
- But you didn't.
- Stop it.

983
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,370
- You wished that I would die.
- Because I was afraid of you!

984
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:03,789
I was ten years old...

985
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,418
and you were a monster.

986
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:13,633
And I know that it's not fair. You...

987
01:40:13,716 --> 01:40:14,926
You needed help.

988
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,012
But I couldn't.

989
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:25,019
And I have carried that guilt...

990
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:29,482
for my entire life.

991
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:36,405
And I... I have to let it go.

992
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:40,284
I have to let it go.

993
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,751
This is not real.

994
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:51,128
But Rose,

995
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:55,675
your mind makes it real.

996
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:01,305
What are you?

997
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:04,350
Why are you doing this to me?

998
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:06,936
Because your mind...

999
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:10,147
is so inviting.

1000
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:04,910
You can't escape your mind, Rose.

1001
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,711
It's...

1002
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:17,298
It's my mind.

1003
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,058
You can't escape it either.

1004
01:42:42,073 --> 01:42:43,783
Rose!

1005
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,204
Rose!

1006
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:13,497
Holy shit.

1007
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,835
Are you okay?

1008
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,421
- Can I just come in for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1009
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:27,887
Where have you been?

1010
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:34,310
I'm sorry.

1011
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:41,776
I'm sorry for dragging you into
my whole fucked-up mess.

1012
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,905
For most of my life,

1013
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:51,827
I've been afraid of
letting people get too close,

1014
01:44:52,661 --> 01:44:55,206
because I was afraid of...

1015
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:01,212
what they might see if they really looked.

1016
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:06,300
And so I... I put walls up,
and I kept people at a distance.

1017
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:10,471
And then...

1018
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:15,518
I met you,

1019
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:19,480
and I could feel those walls coming down.

1020
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:22,483
And it scared the shit out of me.

1021
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:26,779
And so...

1022
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:34,286
I was selfish,
and that was not fair to you.

1023
01:45:36,288 --> 01:45:39,708
And I am so, so sorry.

1024
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:45,881
And I'm...
I'm being selfish again by even asking,

1025
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:47,299
but do you think that...

1026
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:49,969
That I could stay here and just...

1027
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:53,931
just sleep?

1028
01:45:57,226 --> 01:45:58,435
Could you...

1029
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,731
stay with me while I sleep?

1030
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:07,987
Please.

1031
01:46:09,655 --> 01:46:11,866
Yeah, of course I'll stay with you.

1032
01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:21,166
I'll stay with you forever.

1033
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,966
No.

1034
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:37,308
No.

1035
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:39,685
No, no, no, no.

1036
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:41,812
No, no.

1037
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:57,661
No.

1038
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:24,104
Rose.

1039
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:29,777
No, no, no!

1040
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:38,869
Rose!

1041
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,497
Rose, open the door!

1042
01:47:43,499 --> 01:47:44,792
Open the door.

1043
01:47:48,045 --> 01:47:49,171
Rose!

1044
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:51,674
Rose.

1045
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:02,267
No!

1046
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:05,229
- No!
- Fuck.

1047
01:48:06,355 --> 01:48:07,898
Hold on. I'm coming!

1048
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:10,484
No!

1049
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:15,155
Rose!

1050
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,743
No!

1051
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,162
Rose.

1052
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:38,655
Rose?

1053
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:45,871
Rose?
